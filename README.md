# ForecasWatch 2

Once upon a time I relied on *ForecasWatch* as the daily driver watchface on my beloved red Pebble Time. Recently, the free tier of the Weather Underground API on which the watchface relied was discontinued, making a huge portion of the watchface unusable.

The developer, RCY, is nowhere to be found in the Rebble era. I plan to continue using my Pebble(s) for years to come, so this is my attempt to revive this wonderful watchfaceâ€”and this time it's open source!
